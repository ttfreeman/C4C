# Code for Canada Skills Challenge, Developers 2020

This is a Nodejs program for analysing the dataset provided for the challage. It calculates:
1. The number of violations in each category,
2. The earliest and latest violation date for each category.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded and changed the directory into `C4C` directory, use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependancies. To do so, run the following command from inside the `C4C` directory in the terminal:

```bash
cd C4C

npm install
```

## Usage

The output for the tasks requested in the challenge will be printed in the console. You should see the output as soon as you run the command below (while still inside the `C4C` directory) in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Test

Sample tests are written and the command below will run them. If you make changes to the code, please make sure to update the tests as appropriate.

```bash
npm run test
```
